# zeduuid

A UUID generator extension for the Zed editor

For now, the Zed extension API only allows slash commands in the assistant panel, so that's what this extension does. In the future, I'd prefer a keystroke to inject the UUID at the cursor location.

After installing the extension, use `/uuidv4` in the assistant panel to generate a uuid.
